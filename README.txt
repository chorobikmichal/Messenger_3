The Messenger Program allows the user to login and add themselves to different message streams and post messages to them. Users can also view the message streams and apply settings to those streams such as sorting by date or in alphabetical order or marking all messages as read. As the user reads the streams the website automatically marks different messages as read so that when the user opens a stream again they see the newest unread messages first. I have recently changed its interface from Python ncurses to a web interface written in HTML and PHP with the use of dynamic web programming in order to optimize usibilty of the program.
