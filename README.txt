Once you go past the first or last message you will start just seeing blank field instead of a message.

You can't add the same author twice to the same stream. Basically the stream user daat file can't have the same user in it listed twice.

When you sort alfabetically the users starting with a capital letter fill be listed first

Last read messages and the mark all read option don't work when viewing all streams. Works fine for individual streams

the flags always have to be passed as the first argument
